# Roadmap

[ ] Increase and sort the food database
[ ] Allow the user to manage the database, maybe using the extension's local storage or IndexDB
[ ] Better RegEx matching: allow modifiers such as juice, sauce, grilled (lemon juice, tomato sauce, grilled chicken...)
[ ] Better RegEx macthing: highlight plurals correctly
[ ] Add a description as to why a food alleviates or triggers GERD symptoms
[ ] Allow the user to toggle the highlights with a button or checkbox
[ ] Classify the foods (anti-inflamatory, acidic, etc) - Use labels and/or icons
